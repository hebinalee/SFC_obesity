## SFC_obesity - Sensitivity analyses ##
We performed several sensitivity analyses to confirm robustness of our results.<br />

- **bootstrap_approach.m**　　-----　We opted for a bootstrap-based approach by randomly selecting 90% of subjects with replacement</br>
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 1,000 times and repeating our main analysis<br />
- **control_age_sex.m**　　　　-----　As age and sex showed significant differences between the individuals with healthy weight and overweight, we additionally performed SFC analysis after controlling these factors from the functional connectivity.<br />
- **control_TFEQ.m**　　　　　-----　As the eating behavior scores, especially dietary restraint and disinhibition, were significantly different between the groups, we conducted SFC analysis after controlling for TFEQ scores.<br />
- **high_low_risk.m**　　　　　-----　We investigated between-group differences in SFC between low- and high-health risk groups defined based on the world health organization (WHO) criteria.<br /><br />
